# RED WINE QUALITY PREDICTION(LOGISTIC REGRESSION)
The "Red Wine Quality Prediction" project makes use of supervised machine learning to predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical components includes acidity levels, citric acid, sugar content, chlorides, sulfur dioxide levels, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol percentage, and general quality. This gives an assessment and prediction of how good or bad a red wine might be based on its chemical makeup.It demonstrates practical applications of data science through Python, Pandas and Flask for web deployment.

# Dataset Columns:
## a) fixed acidity
## b) volatile acidity
## c) citric acid
## d) residual sugar
## e) chlorides
## f) free sulfur dioxide
## g) total sulfur dioxide
## h) density
## i) pH
## j) sulphates
## k) alcohol
## l) quality

# LOGISTIC REGRESSION
Logistic Regression is a statistical technique used to predict the probability of a binary outcome, such as good and bad quality, in a dataset given input variables like acidity levels and sugar content. In the project of "Red Wine Quality Prediction," this method is applied to classify which wines have the likelihood of being rated good or bad according to their chemical attributes.
